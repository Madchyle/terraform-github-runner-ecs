# Runner Infra Module - Input Variables
################################################################################
#
# This file defines all input variables for the `runner_infra` Terraform module.
# These inputs control the shared AWS infrastructure that runner services run on:
# - **ECS cluster**: a logical “pool” in Amazon ECS where services/tasks run.
# - **EC2 capacity**: optional “worker” EC2 instances (via an Auto Scaling Group)
#   that the ECS cluster uses to place containers when `launch_type = "EC2"`.
# - **Networking**: which VPC/subnets/security groups the instances use.
# - **Maintenance**: optional host-level cleanup to prevent Docker disk bloat.
#
# Each variable below includes:
# - A short comment explaining what it is/does (for quick scanning)
# - A Terraform `description` attribute used by `terraform docs` and validation
#
