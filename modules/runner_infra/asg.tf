# Runner Infra Module - ASG + Launch Template (EC2 host layer)
#
# This file defines the EC2 “ECS container instances” host layer for `launch_type = "EC2"`.
# It creates:
# - A Launch Template: the “recipe” for EC2 instances (AMI, networking/SGs, instance profile, disks, user-data).
# - An Auto Scaling Group (ASG): the fleet manager that launches/replaces/scales EC2 instances using the launch template.

# Resource: EC2 Launch Template for the ECS container instances (the EC2 hosts running the ECS agent).
#
# What it is:
# - Launch Template: an EC2 instance “recipe” (AMI, instance type, networking, IAM instance profile, storage, user-data).
#
# What it attaches to:
# - Used by `aws_autoscaling_group.github_runner_asg.launch_template` below (so the ASG can launch instances from it).
# - Provides instance networking (ENI + security groups), IAM instance profile, and disks that the launched instances will have.
