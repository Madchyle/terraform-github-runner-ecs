# Runner Service Module - ECS Task Definition + ECS Service
#
# This file defines the *workload layer* for the GitHub Actions runner (the runner is defined in the runner_service module and runs on the EC2 or fargate as defined in the runner_infra module):
# - An ECS Task Definition: the template describing how to run the runner container(s)
#   (image, env, logging, volumes, CPU/memory, etc.).
# - An ECS Service: the controller that keeps `desired_count` copies of the task running
#   on the selected capacity (EC2 “container instances” or Fargate) (as defined in runner_infra module).

# Resource: ECS task definition for the GitHub runner workload.
#
# What it is:
# - ECS Task Definition: a versioned “run specification” for one or more containers.
#
# What it attaches to:
# - Referenced by `aws_ecs_service.github_runner_service.task_definition` below (so the service knows what to run).

  # What it is: container definition JSON for the runner container(s).
  # Definition: ECS expects container definitions as JSON; we render it from `ecs_task_definition.json.tpl`.
  #
  # IMPORTANT:
  # - JSON does not support comments, and ecs_task_definition.json.tpl in runner_service module must render to valid JSON for ECS.
  # - So we document what ecs_task_definition.json.tpl in runner_service module does here (without changing the rendered output).
  #
  # Template overview (`ecs_task_definition.json.tpl`):
  # - **Container: `efs-init`** (non-essential)
  #   - Purpose: initialize directories on the mounted EFS volume and write a permissive `.gitconfig`
  #     (`safe.directory = *`) to avoid Git safety errors when Actions checks out repos as root.
  #   - Mounts: `${source_volume_name}` at `${container_path}` (EFS mount from the task `volume { name = "runner-efs" }`).
  #   - Logs: awslogs stream prefix `efs-init`.
  #
  # - **Container: `docker`** (optional, only when `enable_dind = true`)
  #   - Purpose: Docker-in-Docker sidecar (listens on `tcp://0.0.0.0:2375`) for jobs needing Docker.
  #   - Health check: `docker info` (runner waits for HEALTHY before starting).
  #   - Mounts: `${source_volume_name}` at `/home/runner` (so builds can access the workspace on EFS).
  #   - Logs: awslogs stream prefix `dind`.
  #
  # - **Container: `runner`** (essential)
  #   - DependsOn: `efs-init` COMPLETE; and (if enabled) `docker` HEALTHY.
  #   - Image: `"${aws_account_id}.dkr.ecr.${aws_region}.amazonaws.com/${runner_image}"`.
  #   - Privileged: `${runner_privileged}` (set when DinD enabled on EC2).
  #   - Secrets: `RUNNER_TOKEN` from SSM parameter
  #     `arn:aws:ssm:${aws_region}:${aws_account_id}:parameter/${runner_token_ssm_parameter_name}`.
  #   - Mounts:
  #     - EFS: `${source_volume_name}` at `/home/runner` (persistent workspace).
  #     - tmpfs: `runner-tmpfs` at `/runner` and `runner-data-tmpfs` at `/runner-data` (ephemeral).
  #   - Logs: awslogs stream prefix `runner`.
  #
  # Other notable behaviors in the template:
  # - Runner runs as root (`"user": "0:0"`) and sets `RUNNER_ALLOW_RUNASROOT=1`.
  # - Sets debug env vars (`ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG` / `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`) to `"true"`.
  # - Uses tmpfs mounts for `/runner` and `/runner-data` and EFS for `/home/runner`.
  #
  # Template inputs:
  # - See the inline comments on each `templatefile(...)` variable below for the precise mapping. (from aws_region to runner_privileged)
  #
  # Note: `read_only_volume` is currently passed into the template variables for future use/documentation;
  # the template currently mounts EFS with `"readOnly": false`.
